              <h2>Inspiration</h2>
              <p>We elected to review the states electing to expand medicaid in the time since the exchanges were enacted in 2014.  
                In our analysis, we choose to review the states by the health rankings performed annually by the United Health Foundation 
                across multiple metrics grouped by behavioral, community and environment, policy, and clinical care to determine the 
                health outcomes of the states.  By connecting the outcomes to states adopting to expand access to care through the 
                Medicaid Expansion associated with the Affordable Care Act, we could see trends on how many of the lower ranked states 
                were those who elected not to offer expand Medicaid.  However, there are states still electing to do so as of this year 
                and others who elected but have not enacted the expansion in the dataset.</p>

              <h2>Process</h2>
              <p>During our analysis, we found challenges in the consistency of the data as it was reported and stored across the historical years.  
                Particularly challenging was the Medicaid enrollment data from the years 2013 - 2016 before CMS began consistently providing CSV files 
                on their site.  Additionally, we found challenges in the data provided as more metrics were added the years since initial reporting began.  
                We found a similar issue in the metrics for the state Health Rankings as the United Health Foundation has added more elements as they have 
                become available during the same time range.  Due to this, we found our focus on what elements we could compare let to those items which 
                were reported consistently during all years.</p>
