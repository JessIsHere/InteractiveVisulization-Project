# Project-2: Dashboard Page


## Question 
We elected to review the states electing to expand medicaid in the time since the exchanges were enacted in 2014. In our analysis, we choose to review the states by the health rankings performed annually by the United Health Foundation across multiple metrics grouped by behavioral, community and environment, policy, and clinical care to determine the health outcomes of the states. By connecting the outcomes to states adopting to expand access to care through the Medicaid Expansion associated with the Affordable Care Act, we could see trends on how many of the lower ranked states were those who elected not to offer expand Medicaid. However, there are states still electing to do so as of this year and others who elected but have not enacted the expansion in the dataset.
